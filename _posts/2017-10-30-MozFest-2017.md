As a Hive NYC Leadership Grant recipient, I attend MozFest 2017.  Sad to hear about Hive NYC, hopeful for my friends and colleagues.  and for all of the support and community they have created. I would particularly like to show gratitude to Hana Sun.  I would like to thank Hive NYC also for all of the friendships it has facilitated.  And for the resources that have allowed programs like Playable Fashion and Rap Research Lab to run and provide awesome teen programming for hundreds of youth around NYC. Secondly, I attended Glass Room.  Thirdly, MozFest itself.  Met people and also saw Radical Networks speakers and those I need to invite for next year.
